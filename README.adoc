# Groovy UpCloud

Groovy UpCloud is an unofficial library that provides an asynchronous Groovy interface to the UpCloud API.

## Features

Groovy UpCloud library is fully asynchronous.  When invoking the API, the HTTP transaction is performed in a pool
of background threads, and the results are passed to the application.  The communication (currently) happens via
callbacks.  By default, the IO thread pool has four workers, i.e. four HTTP transactions concurrently.

When used as a base for Groovy scripting, UpCloud Groovy provides a script base class that makes it easier to
deal with the concurrent nature: the top-level code and all the callbacks are executed in a dedicated thread, separate
from the IO thread pool.

Groovy UpCloud library has full support for UpCloud API version 1.2.7 (current as of Jul 2018).

## Requirements

Groovy UpCloud is built on Groovy (2.4) and Java 8.  This library is available at
