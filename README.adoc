# Groovy UpCloud

Groovy UpCloud is an unofficial library that provides an asynchronous Groovy interface to the UpCloud API.

## Features

Groovy UpCloud library is fully asynchronous.  When invoking the API, the HTTP transaction is performed in a pool
of background threads, and the results are passed to the application.  The communication (currently) happens via
callbacks.  By default, the IO thread pool has four workers, i.e. four HTTP transactions concurrently.

When used as a base for Groovy scripting, UpCloud Groovy provides a script base class that makes it easier to
deal with the concurrent nature: the top-level code and all the callbacks are executed in a dedicated thread, separate
from the IO thread pool.

Groovy UpCloud library has support for following UpCloud APIs:

 * getting account information
 * listing prices, zones, timezones, plans, and server sizes
 * listing and creating servers, IP addresses, tags, and storage devices
 * loading, modifying, and deleting  servers
 * starting, stopping, and restarting a server, including soft and hard stops
 * attaching and detaching storage devices to a server
 * inserting and ejecting CD-roms
 * managing firewall rules for a server (list rules, getting details, adding, and deletion of individual rules)
 * adding and removing tags from a server
 * loading, modifying, and deleting storage devices
 * cloning and templatize storage devices
 * creating and restoring backups
 * adding and removing storage devices from favorites
 * modifying and deleting tags
 * loading, modifying, and deleting IP addresses

## Requirements

Groovy UpCloud is built on Groovy and Java 8.  This library is available at
