== Architecture overview

=== API overview

UpCloud API follows the RESTful principles.
HTTP**S** is used for client-server communication, and all operations require authentication.

=== API versioning

Every application written on top of Groovy UpCloud must be aware of the UpCloud API version they are using.
Each version of Groovy UpCloud communicates with one specific version of UpCloud API.

This document describes Groovy UpCloud version {project-version}
which is compatible with and uses UpCloud API version {api-version}.

The UpCloud API is versioned.
The API version is embedded in the base URL of the API.
The base URL, in turn, is embedded in the Groovy UpCloud library.
As a consequence, a specific version of Groovy UpCloud will always talk with a specific version of the API.

Many of the backwards incompatible changes in the UpCloud API require only a version bump in the Groovy UpCloud library,
but might require changes in the applications.

For example, in order to support IPv6, UpCloud API added a mandatory `family` property to the IP address operations.
Since the change was backwards incompatible, the API version was changed from 1.1 to 1.2.
The new API was assigned a new base URL, and the Groovy UpCloud library was updated with the new API base URL.
Groovy UpCloud does not define the resource properties statically,
i.e. there was nothing to update in regards to the IP address operations.
But because the API change was backwards incompatible, so was the Groovy UpCloud change,
and the Groovy UpCloud minor version was bumped.
Applications that made use of the affected IP address operations,
had to stick to the old Groovy UpCloud version until they added the `family` property to the IP address creation.

If UpCloud ever takes some of the older API versions down,
the applications still using that version will start receiving `API_VERSION_OBSOLETE` or `API_VERSION_INVALID`
<<Response codes,error codes>>.

=== Authentication

All operations against UpCloud API require authentication.
An API account is separate from UpCloud account, and one UpCloud account may have multiple API accounts.
API accounts can be created using the https://my.upcloud.com[UpCloud control panel].

In Groovy UpCloud, the authentication is handled by the `API` class.
One application may instantiate as many instances of the `API` class as needed, each with different credentials.
If the credentials are mistyped or revoked, the application will receive `AUTHENTICATION_FAILED` error code.

=== Resource identifiers

UpCloud resources -- such as servers, storages, and IP addresses -- are referred to by unique identifiers.
These identifiers are assigned by the UpCloud API when resources are created.
They follow the version 4 format of the Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) standard.

Groovy UpCloud never interprets the identifiers, and they are visible to the applications as opaque strings.

=== Request and response data formats

Between the applications and Groovy UpCloud, resource representations are instances of `MODEL` class (or subclasses).
Behind the scenes, Groovy UpCloud is using JSON data format when communicating with the UpCloud API.

The conversion between `MODEL`s and JSON is pretty straight forward.

JSON data types `array`, `number`, `string`, `boolean`, and `null` are mapped to a corresponding Groovy data types:
`List`, `Number`, `String`, `Boolean`, and `Object`, respectively.

JSON `object` type is handled a little differently:
if it has only one property and the value of that property is an `array`,
then it is interpreted as a "list wrapper" and mapped to a `List`.
Otherwise it is mapped to a `MODEL`, i.e. recursive interpretation.

The "list wrapper" is a convention used by the UpCloud API.
For example, when requesting a list of servers, the UpCloud API might respond with the following JSON:

[source,json]
----
{ // <1>
    "servers": { // <2>
        "server": [ // <3>
            {
                "hostname": "server1.example.com",
                "state": "started",
                "core_number": "1",
                "memory_amount": "2048"
            },
            {
                "hostname": "server1.example.com",
                "state": "started",
                "core_number": "0",
                "memory_amount": "512"
            }
        ]
    }
}
----
<1> the root type is always a JSON `object` (by convention)
<2> a `servers` property whose value is a "list wrapper" JSON `object`
<3> the actual list of server representations

This JSON will be mapped to a following `MODEL` graph:

[source,groovy]
----
def callbackClosure = { response ->
    assert response.servers instanceof List // <1>
    assert response.servers.size() == 2
    assert response.servers.all { it.class.simpleName == 'Server' } // <2>
    assert response.servers[0].hostname == "server1.example.com"
    assert response.servers[1].coreNumber == "0" // <3>
}
----
<1> the `servers` JSON property is "unwrapped" for Groovier access
<2> the `servers` `MODEL` property contains instances of `Server` model
<3> the JSON style property names are converted to Groovy style names

=== Response codes

The UpCloud API uses regular HTTP status codes to indicate success or failure of the operations.
In addition, error responses will contain an `errorCode` and `errorMessage` properties for more details.

For example, trying to start a server that does not exist might result in the following response:

[source,groovy]
----
import static fi.linuxbox.upcloud.core.http.Status.NOT_FOUND

def callbackClosure = { response ->
    assert response.META.status == NOT_FOUND // <1>
    assert response.error.errorCode == 'SERVER_NOT_FOUND' // <2>
    assert response.error.errorMessage == 'The server 00af0f73-7082-4283-b925-811d1585774b does not exist." // <3>
}
----
<1> the more general `META.status` property corresponds to the HTTP error code of 404 ("Not Found")
<2> the more specific `errorCode` property tells us that it was a server that wasn't found
<3> the `errorMessage` is a human readable explanation and contains the resource ID of the resource that wasn't found

The error codes are defined alongside the API operations.

==== Common error codes

The following is a listing of common error codes.

.Common error codes
|===
| HTTP status code | Error code | Description

| 401
| AUTHENTICATION_FAILED
| Authentication failed using the given username and password.

| 402
| ?
| The request cannot be processed because of insufficient credits.

| 403
|Â ?
| The API account identified by the credentials does not have access to the requested resource.

| 404
| varies
| The requested resource does not exist, but might have existed before.
